# üéâ Fun Calculator

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**, your playful tool for quick arithmetic‚Äîaddition, subtraction, multiplication, and division‚Äîwith a splash of humor and emojis!

## Features

- **Add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, and **divide** two numbers.
- Works with decimals (uses `float` for inputs).
- Simple, engaging console interaction.
- Friendly guidance and emoji-rich commentary throughout the calculation process.

## How It Works

1. **User inputs the first number** (can be a decimal).
2. **User inputs the second number** (also can be a decimal).
3. The program calculates:
    - Sum
    - Difference
    - Product
    - Quotient (dividing first by second, assumes the second number is not zero)
4. Displays all four results in a fun and readable format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.

### Usage

1. Copy the code below into a file named `fun_calculator.py`:

    ```
    # üéâ Welcome to the Fun Calculator! üéâ
    # We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! üòé

    # Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

    # Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Step 3: Time to do some math! üß†

    sum_result = num1 + num2                # Addition
    difference_result = num1 - num2         # Subtraction
    product_result = num1 * num2            # Multiplication
    quotient_result = num1 / num2           # Division (Warning: no zero division check!)

    # Step 4: Show the user the results!
    print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
    print(f"Sum: {sum_result} ‚ûï")
    print(f"Difference: {difference_result} ‚ûñ")
    print(f"Product: {product_result} ‚úñÔ∏è")
    print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result} ‚ûó")
    ```

2. **Run the script**:
    ```
    python fun_calculator.py
    ```

3. **Follow the prompts** to enter two numbers and see your results.

## Notes

- This calculator assumes the user does not input zero as the second number for division. No validation is included for division by zero.
- For an enhanced experience or further validation (like error handling for division by zero), consider adding exception handling or conditional logic as found in more advanced calculator examples[1][3][7].

## Example OutputEnter the first number: 7.5
Enter the second number: 2.5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 10.0 ‚ûï
Difference: 5.0 ‚ûñ
Product: 18.75 ‚úñÔ∏è
Quotient: 3.0 ‚ûó
